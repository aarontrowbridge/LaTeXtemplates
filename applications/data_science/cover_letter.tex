\opening{To the Hiring Manager:}

I'm applying for the position of \position. You will find my resume, with detailed work and research experience, is included.  More information about myself can be found on my website: \href{https://aarontrowbridge.github.io/}{\underline{aarontrowbridge.github.io}}.

My background is in physics and math, which I understand is somewhat atypical, especially when compared to someone with a CS degree, but I believe that my skill set is an advantage. I would argue I'm capable of attacking a wider range of problems, by thinking abstractly and recognizing the essential information.

I am an avid reader and researcher, spending almost as much time reading classic literature as reading research papers, extracting the key insight, and thinking about how I could best implement the idea or tie it together with another idea.  

Given that I am applying for what would be my first job in industry, I want to just say that I understand there would be a learning curve, but I am an extremely eager learner and my potential is uncapped.  Given a chance, I know I can add value as a \position \ at \company.

If you have any questions for me -- about my resume, background, or anything else -- please feel free to reach out to me over email or call me anytime at my phone number in the bottom right.  

\closing{Hope to hear from you soon,}
